# Scraping

Before web services came along, screen scraping was a popular technique for grabbing the output from another application by examining the text it displays on the screen. Scraping is not entirely extinct yet. For web applications, this means making a request to a URL and examining the HTML the server returns. 

You can then parse the HTML to grab the latest news headlines or stock quotes, or do some reconnaissance on an organisation or opposing team, snowball the darkweb, mine github and gitlab for identities (and who knows, a password or two), ... 

Oh dear, this can get out of hand real quickly.

## Ode to the Scraper

I'm looking at this scraper

And feel envious

Of its power, its control

When inundated with information

Or unbearably unclear

It can scrape away the overload

No matter how tough the entire payload

It can always be relied upon to clean up the excess

Why isn't life so easy?

When for us the going gets tough, we are forced to look through it

There is no easy scraping our way to a clear image

In final words, Ode to the Scraper!
